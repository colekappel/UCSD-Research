The Quality Program (QualityProgram.m) Documentation

Saving Results
•	locResults – the folder within the folder that contains newProgramMax64Traces.m that holds all of the quality results. This is the only thing you’ll need to change on the program with regards to saving results.

•	6 folders must be in locResults:

1.	‘VIP Vars Q Program’
2.	‘ROC Curves’
3.	‘Histograms’ 
4.	‘Color Maps AMM’ – within this folder there must be a ‘Term’ and ‘Non Term’ Folder
5.	‘Color Maps MAM’ – within this folder there must be a ‘Term’ and ‘Non Term’ Folder
6.	‘Color Maps MIM’ – within this folder there must be a ‘Term’ and ‘Non Term’ Folder

Patient Data Source
•	TermPatients – array that holds term patients. You will need to modify this to have it hold the names of all of your term patients.
•	NonTermPatients - array that holds non term patients. You will need to modify this to have it hold the names of all of your non term patients.
•	locData- This is the folder within the folder that contains newProgramMax64Traces.m that holds the patients EGM’s as txt files. Within this folder there must be a ‘Term’ and ‘Non Term’ Folder holding those patients data. The names within the ‘Term’ and ‘Non Term’ folders should formatted as S-XXXX.txt (i.e. S-0348.txt).
