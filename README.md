# UCSD-Research
This repository contains the code that I wrote for the electrogram signal quality project that I completed with [Rappel Laboratory at UCSD](https://rappel.ucsd.edu/) and [the Computational Arrhythmia Research Laboratory Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/group/narayanlab/cgi-bin/wordpress/#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20Computational%20Arrhythmia,clarify%20mechanisms%20and%20improve%20therapy.). The goal of the project was to improve ablation techniques in cardiac arrhythmia patients by developing an algorithm in MATLAB to quantify the quality of egms of patients. The software programs contained here were coded entirely by me in MATLAB. This project has been completed, with a paper submitted to [Frontiers in Physiology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology) which has not been published yet but is currently under review.

**High quality color map. The results from the program indicate that patients with higher quality will be more likely to have a successful ablation of atrial fibrillation.**
